# Flask Projects

A collection of Flask projects built during my learning journey, ranging from basic CRUD apps to real-world applications. I will continue adding more projects as I progress with Flask.

## Projects

- **Basic To-Do App** — CRUD operations with Flask.
- **User Management App** — CRUD using Flask-RESTful.
- **Book Management System** — Practice with SQL relationships.
- **Coding Challenges** (inside `coding-challenges/`):
  - Fleet Management App
  - Driver Log App
  - Student Course Registration App
